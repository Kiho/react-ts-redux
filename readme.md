
# React + MDL + Redux Starter project in TypeScript

The goal of this project is to provide a starting base for an Redux react project styled with Material Design Lite in TypeScript.


Features:

* Uses components ported to TypeScript from this project - [React-MDL](https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/)
* Basic form validation.
* Uses react-virtualized as Grid
* CSS and SCSS compilation

## How to run
    npm install

For normal development:

    npm run start

Reload server when code changes:

    npm run start:dev

open [http://localhost:8087/](http://localhost:8087/) in the browser

## Requirements

* Node 4
* TypeScript 2.2.2

## Dependencies

* React + react-router
* Redux + react-redux-form + MDL
* Webpack
* TypeScript loader
* Sass/SCSS loaders
* Typings

Need Babel & Express to run web server

## Goals

I needed a simple structure to support CRUD operation with React front-end and WebAPI back-end.
So I made this POC code for starting a new project with TypeScript.
